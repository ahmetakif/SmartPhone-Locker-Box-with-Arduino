# SmartPhone-Locker-Box-with-Arduino

This repository includes the Arduino code for my project about locking smartphones in a box.

Smartphones are a huge distruption today, avoiding us from studying or focusing on things. This project locks your smartphone in a box for the desired time to let you study. When the given time is over it gives your smartphone back by unlocking the box in which your smartphone is placed. Locking mechanism works with a servo motor.
